                Mount Edward belongs to a wild fermenting gaggle
                of Central Otago vignerons that have evolved like a
                Band of Brothers; all to a varying degree recalcitrant,
                insubordinate, revolutionist, mischievous, ingenious,
                jocular and witty but in the Neo-Darwinism of the
                 New Zealand wine industry, they are the dynamic –
                the avant-garde.
