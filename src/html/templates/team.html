                    Mount Edward belongs to a wild fermenting gaggle
                    of Central Otago vignerons that have evolved like a
                    Band of Brothers; all to a varying degree recalcitrant,
                    insubordinate, revolutionist, mischievous, ingenious,
                    jocular and witty but in the Neo-Darwinism of the
                     New Zealand wine industry, they are the dynamic –
                    the avant-garde.

                    <p>
                        In 1997 as a  Central Otago pioneer founded winery, we started small, making one wine as a family business, now, decades later, we are still a family business, thriving, with our own vineyards, style and ethos. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our heart is about making wines that are delicious, textural, subtle, moreish wines. To keep the head happy we grow unique and small batch wines from single vineyard sites, Pinot Noir to Gamay, Chardonnay to Chenin and much more.
