                <p>We produce outstanding wines because we have our own vineyards and grow our own fruit across the best sub regions in Central Otago.</p>
                <p>We grow all our own fruit organically under Bio gro Certification. Organics is a no brainer for us, both philosophically and for the health of our vineyard. Our wines have more vitality and if they are to taste of place, or represent us as individuals, then why on earth would we want to look after our vineyards in any other fashion.</p>
                <p>We think it important that we certify as it is a good from of accountability, especially when we all have a responsibility to look after our place on this planet.</p>
