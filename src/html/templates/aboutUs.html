                <p>We are Bio gro certified organic, owning all our fruit  across 5 estate vineyards, all in Central Otago, collectively producing wines of provenance and pleasure alike.</p>
                <p>We enjoy breaking new ground, the first in New Zealand to make vermouth,  have wine on tap, early adopters of skin contact and minimal sulphur, we continue to seek out the unique. Our choices, style and techniques reflect, we believe, a growing demand for individual and authentic wine.</p>
                <p>Traditional winemaking, a healthy regard to science, all without a rulebook telling us what to do or how to look. The less you do the better the wine is a truism that guides us via minimal intervention such as no fining, filtration, aids or additives.</p>
                <p>Our motto, Grow your Own Way, is with a care to all around you, surround yourself with people who think the same and enjoy yourselves. </p>
                <p>Wine, people, place are all part of this equation, reflected in how we grow, the places you see our wine, our community involvement to what you see in front of you.</p>
                <p>Talk to us, visit us, pick up a bottle and see how we all fit together.
